[GNUnet](https://https://gnunet.org "GNUnet.org Website") is a new network protocol stack for building secure, distributed, and privacy-preserving applications. With strong roots in academic research, our goal is to replace the old insecure Internet protocol stack.

[GNUnet](https://https://gnunet.org "GNUnet.org Website") is typically run as an overlay network on top of the existing Internet infrastructure forming the basis of a hybrid peer-to-peer mesh and relay backbone for applications to run on. It could just as well be run independently of the Internet, over dedicated radio and cable.

[GNUnet](https://https://gnunet.org "GNUnet.org Website") is made for a free and open society: It's a self-organizing network and it is free software as in freedom. GNUnet puts you in control of your data. You determine which data to share with whom, and you're not pressured to accept compromises.

## OIO

Some of the members of GNUnet you can find in Open Infrastructure Orbit and we are proud of that. GNUnet is made for a free and open society. With its self-organizing network, they mesh the world networks and build open infrastructure.
