CADUS is a non-profit and independent humanitarian aid organization. We provide medical aid in North-East Syria and Iraq. Currently we are also active on Lesvos in Greece. In Berlin we run the Crisis Response Makerspace, where we develop innovative solutions and follow the Open Source principle.

Our humanitarian projects aim at local capacity building. We often work where hardly any other aid organizations are active or where they have withdrawn. Cooperation with local partners and a critical eye on the field of humanitarian aid are particularly important to us.
