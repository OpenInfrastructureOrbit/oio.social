[OpenStreetMap](https://openstreetmap.org "OpenStreetmap.org Website") is built by a community of mappers that contribute and maintain data about roads, trails, cafés, railway stations, and much more, all over the world.

## Local Knowledge

[OpenStreetMap](https://openstreetmap.org "OpenStreetmap.org Website") emphasizes local knowledge. Contributors use aerial imagery, GPS devices, and low-tech field maps to verify that OSM is accurate and up to date.

## Community Driven

[OpenStreetMap](https://openstreetmap.org "OpenStreetmap.org Website")'s community is diverse, passionate, and growing every day. Our contributors include enthusiast mappers, GIS professionals, engineers running the OSM servers, humanitarians mapping disaster-affected areas, and many more. To learn more about the community, see the OpenStreetMap Blog, user diaries, community blogs, and the OSM Foundation website.

## Open Data

[OpenStreetMap](https://openstreetmap.org "OpenStreetmap.org Website") is open data: you are free to use it for any purpose as long as you credit OpenStreetMap and its contributors. If you alter or build upon the data in certain ways, you may distribute the result only under the same licence. See the Copyright and License page for details.

## OIO

[OpenStreetMap](https://openstreetmap.org "OpenStreetmap.org Website") is a part of the Open Infrastructure Orbit and we are proud of that. They map the world, they provide the world, they move the world.
