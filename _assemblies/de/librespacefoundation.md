Libre Space Foundation is a non-profit organization based in Athens, Greece. Its mission is developing open-source space technologies, facilitating an open space for all. Among its projects are SatNOGS – a global SDR based satellite ground-station network – and UPSat, which is the first open-source hardware and software satellite in orbit.

Our Vision is an Open and Accessible Outer Space for all. We believe that space should be claimed the libre (open source) way.

Our Mission is to promote, advance and develop libre (free and open source) technologies and knowledge for space.
To do that we design, develop and deliver space related projects ranging from Ground Station equipment to global monitoring Networks and satellite missions.

Libre Space Foundation (LSF) is a non-profit foundation registered since 2014 in Greece from the creators of the SatNOGS project.
