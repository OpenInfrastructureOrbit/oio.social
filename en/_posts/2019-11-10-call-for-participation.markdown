Dear Communities,

new year, new congress. We are currently organizing the Open Infrastructure Orbit at the 36c3. With you we have either already designed the orbit together last year or we have already planned together this year or you have already joined the orbit.

If not already done, register your assembly at [signup.c3assemblies.de](https://signup.c3assemblies.de/) and assign it to the orbit. Please provide the following information as detailed as possible:
* Space requirements
* Planned activities that must be taken into account during planning
* what do you want to present/exhibit
* Are there larger objects? If yes: please specify exact dimensions (WxHxD)
* Power requirements that exceed those of laptops
* Especially important: any money-handling, if you want to do this to yourselves


within the orbit we offer a stage, a workshop room, the soldering area and presentation tables where projects and communities can be presented. We organize these spaces in Pretalx under [talks.oio.social/36c3-oio/cfp](https://talks.oio.social/36c3-oio/cfp). Please enter your topics there.

The construction of the orbit with stage, soldering area, workshop room, presentation tables and other features costs money. Therefore we started a fundraising campaign on Betterplace: [betterplace.org](https://www.betterplace.org/de/projects/12172-freifunk-net)

Alternatively, donations can also be transferred directly to the account of the "Förderverein freie Netzwerke":

Please spread the call for donations in your communities, we are grateful for any support.

Best regards,

The OIO Orgateam
