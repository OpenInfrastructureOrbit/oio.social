The Open Infrastructure Orbit *(also: the Marina)* is a safe haven for all groups and individuals dealing with and building open infrastructure. During the year we are sailing in different waters. Once a year we meet for the 36c3 in our orbit *(marina)* to exchange our experiences over the last year, as well as our vision for the coming years.

The marina is located in the [centre of Hall 2](https://36c3.c3nav.de/l/oio/ "c3nav location 36c3 Open Infrastructure Orbit"), the Assembly of the 36th Chaos Communication Congress.

We have a stage with presentations, boats with seats where you can meet the various participants in our marina and a workshop room. We also have a lounge and a spot for stickers. See the program [in our Pretalx](https://talks.oio.social/36c3-oio/ "Pretalx 36c3 Open Infrastructure Orbit") and come by!

Further information to the open Infrastructure Orbit and/or Marina can be found in our Wiki on [wiki.freifunk.net/36c3](https://wiki.freifunk.net/36c3).
